        <P>Around the world, cities and towns are feeling the impact of the warming climate and the increasingly severe floods that come along with it. <br> In 2021 alone, millions of people from Tennessee to Germany have seen their lives upended by 100-year and 400-year floods, and it’s likely that these folks could see similar impacts and worse in their lifetimes.</P>

        <p>More extreme flooding must be expected, and for the towns and cities where flooding has already occured, theirs will no longer <br> be a ‘once in a lifetime’ risk but now far more frequent. The reality is that this is the world we <br> live in with 1.1 degree Celsius of warming. These record temperatures, record floods are not anomalous, they are <br> the beginning of a new norm, and the new records will continue to be exceeded, year after year.</p>
